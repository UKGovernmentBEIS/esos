        The highest UK parent of a group is the undertaking that has no parent, or that only has parents which are
        overseas undertakings.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        If a corporate group contains overseas parent undertakings, the group may have more than one highest UK parent
        group. By default each highest UK parent group will participate separately in ESOS. If the highest UK parent
        groups within the same corporate group choose to aggregate and comply as one participant, there must be an
        agreement in writing between all highest parents in the group that specifies which highest UK parent will be the
        responsible undertaking

        The highest UK parent of a group is the undertaking which has no parent, or only has parents which are overseas
        undertakings. All subsidiary undertakings of that highest UK parent are by default part of the same participant
        for ESOS.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        By default the highest UK parent acts as the responsible undertaking – this means it will complete the ESOS
        assessment and notify the Environment Agency of compliance for itself and subsidiary undertakings.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Another undertaking within the highest parent group can be chosen to act as the responsible undertaking provided
        all undertakings in the highest parent group agree this in writing, and keep a copy of this agreement in their
        evidence pack.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Undertakings within a highest UK parent group can disaggregate from one another for the purposes of compliance
        with ESOS, provided they agree in writing with their highest parent, again keeping a copy of this agreement in
        their evidence pack.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Undertakings that disaggregate must each report compliance as two or more separate participants. See

        If a corporate group contains overseas parent undertakings, the corporate group may consist of more than one
        highest UK parent group. In this instance, if one highest UK parent group is in scope of ESOS then every other
        highest UK parent group in the same global group must also participate in ESOS. However, the default in this
        circumstance is that each highest UK parent group will participate separately.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        If the highest UK parent groups within the same corporate group wish to comply as one participant (to
