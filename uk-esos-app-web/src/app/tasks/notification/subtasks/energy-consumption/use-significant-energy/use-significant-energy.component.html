      Your organisation may choose to carry out an energy audit or use an alternative compliance route for areas of
      significant energy consumption. This means those assets and activities which together account for not less than
      95% of the participant's total energy consumption.
    </p>

    <p>
      The de minimis is a maximum of 5% of total energy consumption which may be excluded from the energy audit or
      alternative compliance route. The percentage figure for your organisation must be entered as 'Energy use not
      covered by any compliance routeâ€™ and be a whole number. You may round up a decimal to 5% where that is the nearest
      whole number, but you may not round down to 5%.
    </p>

    <p>Energy can be excluded on the basis of one or a combination of these factors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>site</li>
      <li>group</li>
      <li>asset</li>
      <li>activity</li>
