<govuk-details summary="About Phase 3 Progress Update 1">
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Participants in the third compliance period for ESOS are required to submit two progress updates. You will not be
    able to submit progress updates unless you have submitted an action plan (you will be asked to confirm this in
    MESOS).
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Submitting progress update 1</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">You must complete the first of the two progress updates if you are:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
      A responsible undertaking which submitted an action plan for the third compliance period under an existing MESOS
      account.
    </li>
    <li>
      An undertaking that has left its highest parent group / participant following submission of an action plan, which
      has not agreed to comply with its previous or new group so must comply on its own behalf as the responsible
      undertaking, under a new MESOS account.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    You will be asked whether you have implemented any measures that were proposed in your action plan, and whether you
    have implemented any measures that were not included in your action plan. Estimates will be needed in relation to
    each implemented measure of the reduction in energy consumption resulting during the period between 6 December 2024
    and 5 December 2025. On an optional basis, you will also be able to provide estimates for implemented measures of
    any reductions in energy consumption resulting during the period between 6 December 2023 and 5 December 2024. All
    progress updates will be published by the Environment Agency.Â 
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Only the responsible undertaking can complete and submit progress updates in MESOS. It will not be possible for lead
    assessors to enter, edit or review the information.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    You will be able to save the information entered for your progress updates at any time and return to complete it,
    before submitting it.
